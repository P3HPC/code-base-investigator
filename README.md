Code Base Investigator (CBI) is an analysis tool that provides insight into the
portability and maintainability of an application's source code.

- Measure [code divergence](http://doi.org/10.1109/P3HPC.2018.00006) to
  understand how much code is specialized for different compilers, operating
  systems, hardware micro-architectures and more.

- Visualize the distance between the code paths used to support different
  compilation targets.

- Identify stale, legacy, code paths that are unused by any compilation target.

- Export metrics and code path information required for P3 analysis using [other
  tools](https://intel.github.io/p3-analysis-library/).
