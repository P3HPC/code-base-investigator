# Code Base Investigator Examples

The examples in this directory consist of small, synthetic codebases constructed specifically to demonstrate the functionality of Code Base Investigator (CBI).

Each example demonstrates how to configure CBI using YAML input files and compilation databases, and how to interpret the resulting code divergence metrics.

## Links to Examples

1. [single-source](single-source/README.md)  
   An example codebase using exactly the same code on multiple platforms.

2. [divergent-source](divergent-source/README.md)  
   An example codebase specializing some small regions of code for individual platforms.

3. [disjoint-source](disjoint-source/README.md)  
   An example codebase sharing no code across multiple platforms.
