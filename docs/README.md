The HTML documentation is built with Sphinx, which can be installed by
following [these
instructions](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html).

We use the [furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo) theme, which must be
installed separately.

Other configuration options are documented in source/conf.py.
